# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with LLM

This project demonstrates how to use **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in combination with traditional machine learning techniques to predict stock prices and provide natural language insights. It integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and LLM-based explanations into one end-to-end workflow.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Collects and preprocesses stock market data
- Performs **technical analysis** and feature extraction
- Trains predictive models on stock price movements
- Uses **LangChain** and **OpenAI LLMs** to generate insights, explanations, and human-like interpretations of predictions
- Interactive workflow using Jupyter Notebooks

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arsalan80425/Stock_Price_Prediction_with_LLM.git
   cd Stock_Price_Prediction_with_LLM
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your **OpenAI API key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data Processing & Modeling)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** (Data analysis & ML)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **LangChain** (LLM Orchestration)
- **OpenAI GPT models** (Natural language insights)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive execution)

---

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. Load stock price dataset (e.g., Yahoo Finance or CSV)
2. Apply technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD)
3. Train predictive models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
4. Query the LLM:
   - "Why did the model predict stock X will rise tomorrow?"
   - "Explain the impact of RSI on this prediction"

The LLM provides **natural language explanations** that make the predictions interpretable.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time stock price data
- Experiment with deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers)
- Enhance interpretability using SHAP or LIME
- Deploy as a **web dashboard** with Streamlit/Gradio
